# Takeaway.com - technical test

We're thrilled that you're considering us as your next workplace.

For us to see your capabilities and skills, we have planned a test for you.

## The test

The test has three parts:

### Restaurants list
Create a new project with a restaurant list page. 

Fill the list using the following rest request.

GET:
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/gilgoldzweig/SampleTest/tree/master/restaurants/

** Don't spend much time on how the items look or UI in general. **

### Favorites 

In addition to the pure data of the restaurant's list, we want you to persist the restaurant's favorite state. (The data is purely local and is not a part of the network request)

The data needs to be saved in a database, and it's up to you to decide what info you save and what info you don't.

You donâ€™t need to implement to UI showing and or setting a restaurant as favourite; we want to see how you incorporate the 2 data sets into one screen module, feel free to use any design patterns/architecture you want.

### Mocking 

The final task is mocking the restaurant's request with a mock json file that we provide. Everything else should still work the same way.

##  Submission

Please submit the project as a zip file that contains your project and a readme file with instructions on how we need to compile it.

Android submissions - send to Gil:
gil.goldzweig@takeaway.com

IOS submissions - send to Aran:
aran.erlich@takeaway.com

## Final Notes 
 
- We want to see clean code with testability in mind (there is no need for actual unit/UI tests)
- You can use any open source library you desire.
- The test should take you around 4 hours.

If you have any question feel free to reach us, we are here for you
Good luck
