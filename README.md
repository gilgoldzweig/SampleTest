# Takeaway.com - technical test

We're thrilled that you're considering us as your next workplace.

For us to see your capabilities and skills, we have planned a test for you.

## The test

The test has three parts:

### Restaurants list
Create a new project with a restaurant list page. 

Fill the list using the following rest request.

GET:
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/gilgoldzweig/SampleTest/db

** Don't spend much time on how the items look or UI in general. **

### Favorites 

In addition to loading the pure data of the restaurant's list, we want you to persist the restaurant's favorite state. (The data is purely local and is not a part of the network request)

The state should be set based on a toggle/image/button in the UI. Similar to liking a post on social netowrk.

The data needs to be saved in a database, and it's up to you to decide what info you save and what info you don't.

### Mocking 

The final task is mocking the restaurant's request with a mock json file that we provide. Everything else should still work the same way.

##  Submission

Please submit the project as a zip file that contains your project and a readme file with instructions on how we need to compile it.

Android submissions - send to Gil and Chani:
gil.goldzweig@justeattakeaway.com & chani.aharoni@justeattakeaway.com

IOS submissions - send to Aran and Chani:
aran.erlich@justeattakeaway.com & chani.aharoni@justeattakeaway.com

## Final Notes 
 
- We want to see clean code with testability in mind (there is no need for actual unit/UI tests)
- You can use any open source library you desire.
- The test should take you around 4 hours.

If you have any question feel free to reach us, we are here for you.

Good luck
